## Description
This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation
To install this for local testing:

1. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) installed on your local machine.
2. Next clone this repository. Navigate to the root directory of the copy in your terminal and run the following commands:
```
    npm install
```
3. You will then need to create a MySQL database either through a program such as MySQL Workbench. An `.sql` file to run the query is available in `/db` file.
4. You will then need to create and set up a `.env` file with the following information:
```
    DB_NAME=techblog_db
    DB_USER=  // Your MySQL username here (typically root)
    DB_PASS=  // Your MySQL password here
```
5. Now to seed the database with some example data, return to your root directory of the repo, and run:
```
    npm run seed
```
6. Finally, run the following to start the server:
```
    npm start
```
